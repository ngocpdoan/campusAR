### Overview :bulb:
With the current situation of remote learning, it is common to feel out of the loop. As a solution, SJSU Events serves as a hub for students to post and browse upcoming events all in one place.

### About SJSU Events :loudspeaker:
SJSU Events is a website that serves as a collective space for San Jose State University students to post and browse events. Users are able to publicize their events by uploading flyers and see other events being live updated as they are posted onto the website. **Additionally, SJSU Events has a fun feature called campusAR; a way of viewing flyers and the school map on campus through augmented reality.**

### What is campusAR? :iphone:
With the large quantity of flyers and advertisements frequently being posted on the walls of campus, it is common to feel overwhelmed and flooded with information. Furthermore, the extensive amounts of flyers being produced results in the consumptive practice of single-use paper. As a solution to **kill two birds with one stone**, campusAR serves as an easily accessible and eco friendly alternative to flyers through augmented reality.

With campusAR, users are able to scan QR codes found on posters around campus to view multiple flyers relating to upcoming school events. These minimal QR code posters will effectively cut down the paper waste from single-use flyers while simultaneously serving as a more convenient way to view campus information.

Wait, thereâ€™s more! Due to the lack of school maps around SJSU, campusAR provides a trouble free solution by allowing students to scan a QR code on their student ID to view the campus map. **With the help of augmented reality, information not only becomes more easily accessible, but also serves as a fun user experience!**
